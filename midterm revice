Break Point: One way of using a debugger, which pauses the execution of Python code.

def is_odd(number: int) -> bool:
    """
    Check if a number is odd.

    Args:
    - number (int): The number to check.

    Returns:
    - bool: True if the number is odd, False otherwise.
    """
    return number % 2 != 0


import sys

# Check if the number of command-line arguments is correct
if len(sys.argv) < 2:
    print("Usage: python script_name.py arg1 arg2 ...")
    sys.exit(1)

# Calculate the total length of all arguments
total_length = 0
for arg in sys.argv[1:]:
    total_length += len(arg)

# Calculate the average length
average_length = total_length / (len(sys.argv) - 1)

print("The average length of arguments is: " + str(average_length))
