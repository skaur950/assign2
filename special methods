__eq__, __ne__, __lt__, __gt__, __le__, __ge__: Comparison operators, defining behavior for equality, inequality, less than, greater than, less than or equal to, and greater than or equal to, respectively.
__len__: Defines behavior for the len() function.
__getitem__, __setitem__, __delitem__: Used to implement indexing and slicing for objects.
__iter__, __next__: Used to make objects iterable.
